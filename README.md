This project is an engine for generating and analyzing four-part textures (and eventually other forms) in the style of Bach and the classical era. Currently, it allows one to pass a series of constraints, such as chord/type/inversion and voice parts, and it will produce the complete texture using the settings provided. It also gives many useful basic music theory functions like intervals and chords.
